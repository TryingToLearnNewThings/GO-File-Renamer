**This is just a repo of me trying to learn GoLang with a File Renamer** 

The process of this program is:

1. User types in the Data it need
    - First the Directory where the files are located

    - Then the name of the current file that needs to be renamed

    - After that the user types in the New name that he wants

2. After the Data is collected the Program looks through the named directory and scans for the name of the File

3. after the scan it beginns to rename the files to the respective new name that it is given.

<br>
<p>(Just for testing)</p>
4. After 8 second the files will be reverted back
    - just so I dont have to rename them back after each run. (for convenience)

5. In the Future: add checks after it changed the files to the new names to let the user check if it was successfully done or if not revert back to the old name and try again
